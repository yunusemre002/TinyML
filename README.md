# Fall Detection with Arduino Nano 33 BLE and Edge Impulse

This project aims to detect human falls using the **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense** and **Edge Impulse**. We used motion sensor data collected from the device, trained a machine learning model on Edge Impulse, and deployed it to the microcontroller for real-time fall detection.

> **Project Report (English Translation):**  
> This project investigates fall detection using an embedded machine learning approach. Accelerometer and gyroscope data were collected from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board under different motion scenarios. A classification model was trained using Edge Impulse’s platform, and then deployed to the device. The system aims to detect falls in real time and trigger appropriate alerts, demonstrating the feasibility of TinyML solutions on low-power hardware.
